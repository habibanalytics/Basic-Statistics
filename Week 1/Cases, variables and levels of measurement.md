# variables and cases
Variables are features of something or someone. And cases are that something or someone.

**Example**: 
Player characteristics are variables. The players themselves are cases. If we want to study some characetristics of footbal players like body weight etc.

* A variable needs to vary.
* When there is no variation it becomes a constant.

# levels of measurement
there are many different kinds of variables

## categorical variables.
### nominal level.
A nominal variable is made up of various categories that 
* Differ from each other
* There is no order

**Example**: 
The gender of the football players or the city the football teams come from

### ordinal level
* Differ from each other
* There is an order

**Example**: How much the number one was better than the number two.

## quantitative variables
(They can be Discrete or continuous values)
### Interval level.
* Differ from each other
* There is an order
* Similar intervals between the categories

**Example**: The age of a football player. 
We can say that a player of 18 years old differs from a player of 16 years old, in terms of his or her age.

In addition, we can say that this player is older. But we can also say that in terms of age, the difference between a 18 year old player and a 16 year old player, is similar to the difference between a 14 year old player and a 12 year old player.

### Ratio level
* Differ from each other
* There is an order
* Similar intervals between the categories
* Has a meaningful zero point

**Example**: A player's body height, measured in centimeters.

A height of zero centimeters means that there is no height at all. Note that we cannot say that age has a meaningful zero point, because an age of zero does not mean that there is no age. Age therefore is an interval variable.

**Quantitative variables can also be distinguished in discrete and continuous variables.**

**Countable and calculateable**

A variable is continuous if the possible values of the variable form an interval. An example is again, the height of a player.

* For many statistical analyzes, the differences between the interval and ratio level are not that important. 
* Moreover, many statisticians argue that if you have an ordinal variable measured on a scale with ten categories or even more, you are allowed to analyze this variable as if it were quantitative.
